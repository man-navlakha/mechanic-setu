# 🚀 EAS (Expo Application Services) Setup Guide

## 📝 Step 1: Create Expo Account

### Method 1: Via Browser (Opened for you!)

A browser window should have opened to: https://expo.dev/signup

1. **Fill in the form**:
   - Email address
   - Username (e.g., "man-navlakha")
   - Password
   - Agree to terms

2. **Verify your email**:
   - Check your inbox
   - Click the verification link

3. **Done!** Your account is created

### Method 2: Via CLI

If the browser didn't open, run:
```bash
npx expo register
```

---

## 🔐 Step 2: Login to EAS

Once your account is created:

```bash
eas login
```

Enter:
- **Email or username**: (the one you just created)
- **Password**: (your password)

---

## 🎯 Step 3: Configure Your Project

After logging in, initialize EAS for your project:

```bash
eas build:configure
```

This will:
1. Create `eas.json` with build profiles
2. Link your project to your Expo account
3. Generate a project ID

---

## 📱 Step 4: Build Your App

### For Android:

```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

### For iOS (requires Mac or EAS Build):

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```
